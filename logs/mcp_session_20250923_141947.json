However, I can still provide general recommendations tailored to your situation as a night owl with the goal of improving sleep quality. Here are some personalized tips:\n\n### Personalized Sleep Recommendations for Diego:\n\n1. **Optimize Your Sleep Environment**:\n   - **Darkness**: Use blackout curtains to block out light. Consider a sleep mask if necessary.\n   - **Quiet**: Use white noise machines or earplugs to minimize disturbances.\n   - **Cool Temperature**: Keep your bedroom at a comfortable, cool temperature (around 60-67°F or 15-19°C).\n\n2. **Establish a Relaxing Pre-Sleep Routine**:\n   - Spend 30-60 minutes winding down before bed. Activities can include reading, light stretching, or meditation.\n   - Avoid stimulating activities (like intense exercise or stressful work) close to bedtime.\n\n3. **Limit Screen Exposure**:\n   - Try to reduce screen time at least 1-2 hours before bed to prevent blue light from interfering with melatonin production.\n   - If you must use screens, consider blue light blocking glasses or apps.\n\n4. **Maintain a Consistent Schedule**:\n   - Stick to the same sleep and wake times, even on weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.\n   - Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night.\n\n5. **Mind Your Diet**:\n   - Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening. Instead, consider herbal teas or warm milk before bed.\n   - Limit heavy or rich foods close to bedtime; opt for light snacks if you're hungry.\n\n6. **Incorporate Relaxation Techniques**:\n   - Practice deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation to reduce stress before bed.\n   - Journaling can also help clear your mind of worries.\n\n7. **Exercise Regularly**:\n   - Continue going to the gym around 3:00 PM, as regular physical activity can promote better sleep.\n   - Try to avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime.\n\n8. **Stay Hydrated, but Not Too Much**:\n   - Drink enough water during the day, but limit fluid intake close to bedtime to avoid waking up for bathroom trips.\n\n### Monitoring Your Progress:\nKeep track of your sleep quality and any changes in your stress levels. If you notice improvements, continue with your routine. If not, consider adjusting your bedtime or seeking professional advice.\n\nIf you have any specific concerns or additional questions, feel free to ask!",
